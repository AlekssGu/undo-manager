### Undo manager for Text Editor

Source code consists of a set of interfaces which form the model of an undo-manager for a text editor. 

The exercise consists in implementing the interfaces **UndoManager** and **UndoManagerFactory**, including unit tests. 

The other interfaces should be used "as is" - i.e. the implementation of UndoManager and UndoManagerFactory should not rely on any specific implementation of the other interfaces. 

You are free to use third-party software libraries in your solution if you want.
